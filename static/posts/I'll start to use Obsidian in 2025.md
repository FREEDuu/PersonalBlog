## why i'll start

Because i'm start to feel the necessity of producing something instead of consuming , i want to share value and learn every day something new

## I'll setup all my ideas and notes/information

Using Obsidian i'll track everything i learn this year and in 2026 i'll see if obsidian is a valid tool to do so

## The Big and Final idea

The big idea is to create an online and easy shareable graph of my knowledge in the future, something like the graph view of obsidian but open source
